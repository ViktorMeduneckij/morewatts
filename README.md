# MoreWatts
A hobby project created for MoreWatts cycling. Main idea is to have calendar with upcoming training sessions, so that cyclists could attend them. A user can add/remove himself from a list, dedicated staff members can create new training sessions.

## How
Implemented with `nodeJs` in the backend and `React` on the frontend. Hosted on Heroku, can be reached on https://www.morewatts-treniruotes.com/

## Tech debt
Project was done in a hurry therefore lacks in some departments. There is no proper user authorization, staff members are recognized in a unsafe manner.
